      "Carried out the AI Copilots project for the Consumer Centric Innovation department/ Smoke free products (Philip Morris International, Lausanne office).

I also coded a web-based interface (using HTML and CSS) to provide the breakdown of testing results, justification for recommended tools, sample generated outputs and specific prompt engineering guides in an easily accessible format for the team. Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript. Client: Rehouven Libine.",
